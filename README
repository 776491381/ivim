This is my VIM configure and it could run cross different platforms including Windows and *nix. It's better to use gvim instead of vim in Windows, so gvim is the preferable choice when you use Windows. If you use mac, I recommend to use iTerm and MacVim. This is my first time to use github. If you love my configure or have some questions about this configure, please feel free to contact me! Thank you!

If you want to install this configure in your computer, please run these
commands in your terminal:
1 git clone http://github.com/gmarik/vundle.git $HOME/.vim/bundle/vundle
2 git clone http://github.com/kepbod/kepbod-vim-configure.git $HOME/vimrc
3 cp $HOME/vimrc/.vimrc $HOME/.vimrc
4 vim .vimrc
5 :BundleInstall!
6 Just enjoy it!

PS: This configure needs git support. What's more, it needs lucius colorscheme, so you can download it from http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2536 and install it in the right path. Last but not least, the Command-T and ACK require ruby running time and Perl module App::Ack, and you can check :help command-t.txt and :help Ack.txt for more details.
